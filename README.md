# HackTheStrategy


A codebase for the StrategySimulator challange from Morgan Stanley at Go You Have The GUTS 2025

## Running the Game

Download the latest release JAR and run (requires java 21):

```bash
java -jar *.jar
```
## Running from sauce

If I blundered with a .jar release, you can always run the game directly from the project directory:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```
